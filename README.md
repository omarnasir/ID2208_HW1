XML PROCESSING APPLICATION

This repository contains implementations of DOM, JAXB, SAX and XSLT parsers, all written in JAVA. An employement service company has been simulated, which has multiple sources of input XMLs. Each contains some specific information that has to be parsed and then mapped into an output.xml. The output xml is serialized using JAXB Marshaller methods, through Java BEAN classes.
